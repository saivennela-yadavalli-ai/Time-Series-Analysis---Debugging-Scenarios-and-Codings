# Time Series Analysis – Debugging, Coding Tasks & Scenario Solutions

This repository contains my complete work on Time Series Analysis, including:
- Debugging tasks
- Coding implementations
- Scenario-based conceptual explanations
- Dataset handling and visualisation
- ARIMA preparation and forecasting logic

---

## 📌 Contents

### 1. **Debugging.ipynb**
Notebook containing fixed and corrected code for various Time Series functions.  
All corrections follow the rule: *modify only the error line without touching the rest of the code*.

### 2. **Codings.ipynb**
Includes minimal Python code for the following tasks:
- Loading and visualising datasets  
- Missing value checks  
- Time series decomposition  
- Stationarity testing (ADF)  
- Train-test splitting  
- Forecast visualisation  

### 3. **Scenario-based Questions with Solutions (PDF)**
Contains 8 scenario-based explanations covering:
- Trend detection  
- Seasonality identification  
- Making data stationary  
- Choosing the right model (ARIMA, SARIMA, Holt’s Trend)  
- Forecast accuracy evaluation  
- Handling sudden spikes  
- Understanding repeated seasonal patterns  
- Missing value treatment before forecasting
